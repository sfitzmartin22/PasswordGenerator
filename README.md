# Your Project Title
Password Generateor

## Description
Password protection is a vital part of protecting one of the most valuable assets that a company has, their data.  This project's goal is to automatically generate a secure password for a new employee that has access to sensitive data that, if breached, could have devastating effects on a companies reputation and profitability.  I have approached this task by writing a javascript code that uses objects and functions to automatically generate a password based on a users input for what specifications they want.  Once a user answers what length they want their password to be, between 8-128 characters, they are then asked a series of questions to specify what characters they want to be used to generate a password.  This password is then randomly generated and printed on the website browser for viewing.
